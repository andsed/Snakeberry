Snakeberry
==========

A lightweight webservice based media player fpr Raspberry Pi. At the moment the webservice can play web radio using mplayer.
I am also planning to make it play MP3s from network or local resources and even more.
To control this service there is an Android App, but of course there is also an easy to use service API so you can build a ramote app for every plattform you like!
Just take a look at the wiki to find out more about this project.
